                    Dr Kalam Donation is designed for the NSS unit and library of the UC College, Aluva. DKD offers the option for anyone to search for donors in UC College .
                    The app is an aggregation of blood donors consisting of students and staff of UC college.</b><br>The app is created in collaboration with Vidya Education and Dr Kalam Youth Forum and NGO powered by Jerin Jacob Paul. Aenosh K Santhosh and Sneha Mathai were a paramount part to the development of the application. 
                    This app wouldn't have been possible without them and we're grateful to:<br>
